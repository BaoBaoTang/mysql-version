Scenario:
=========
If Fall, then enemy fighters will be moving through the valley.

If enemy fighters are moving through the valley, and there are many
#people in the valley then there may be an HVT with them.
enemy fighters in the valley then there may be an HVT with them.

If there is an HVT in the valley and it is safe, then carry out the mission

Campfires in the valley indicate many people in the valley.

The UAV sees campfires.

It is Fall.

Paid informants say that there are Al Queda operatives in the valley.

A patrol reports well organised fighters in the valley.

Well organised foreign fighters may be AQ.

The recon team reports well entrenched positions.

The recon team reports many people in the valley.

The recon team reports foreigners in the valley.

If there are well entrenched AQ operatives in the valley it is not
safe to attack.

If we are well equipped, then it is safe.

We are well equipped.


Thoughts:
========
So we have something like:

fall => enemy

enemy & many => HVT

HVT & safe => mission

campfires => many

campfires

fall

(all of which gives an argument to carry out the mission based on the UAV
data and also the data from the recon team).

informants => aq

patrol => well-organised

well-organised & foreign => aq

foreign

well-entrenched

well-entrenched & aq => not safe

(which gives an argument against safety based on data from the informants,
recon team and patrol)

well-equipped => safe

well-equipped

(which gives an argument for safety)

The two safety arguments will attack each other, and "not safe" will
attack the "mission" argument.

-----------------

I think that this is much closer to the real situation, where:

1) We trust the UAV a lot.

2) We don't trust the informants much.

3) We trust the recon team a lot.

4) We trust the patrol almost as much as the recon team and UAV.

however, unlike before, not all all the rules are strong.

5) "well-equipped => safe" is middling in strength.

6) "well-organised & foreign => aq" is also middling

(The other rules are all strong, by which I think I mean they have value 1).

My sense is that this comes down to how you weight the two middling
rules (5 and 6 separately), and the weights and combination of trust
in patrol and informants (combination of 2, 3 and 4) which will
provide the strengths of the three interacting arguments.
